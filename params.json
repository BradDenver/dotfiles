It performs the following actions:\r\n* checks for dependencies\r\n* pulls latests revision of repo and updates submodules\r\n* backs up existing file/folders to `$HOME/.dotfiles-backup/`\r\n* installs files\r\n* creates `$HOME/.vim/tmp` & `$HOME/.vim/bundle` if they dont already exist\r\n* installs [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) if not installed already\r\n* installs/updates Vim plugins via Vundle  \r\n\r\nThe main differences from Giannis script is that the `$HOME/.vim/tmp` & `$HOME/.vim/bundle` folders are not removed and recreated and that Vim plugins are installed via Vundle rather than submodules\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Install read only\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/BradDenver/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install read write\r\nAssuming a GitHub username of \"UserName\", fork of this repo and then\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://UserName@github.com/UserName/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Update\r\n```\r\nsource ~/dotfiles/bootstrap.sh\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
